## Overview
As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, I am now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In my new role, I will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program. Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so my first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers. My task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.

The data here shows the most common rider was born in 1969, and the most ridden day for January 2020 was Jan 11th. Data shows the most common start and end location is 8th Ave & W 31st, while the most common starting time to ride is at about 11AM and the ending time is 10AM. This location could be a bike rack that is a very popular area of the city, and starting time can be explained as people riding to get lunch or exercise during their break, and ending time could be due to someone getting to work. There is no trend based off the customer type and their starting/ending geographic location, besides some outliers.
